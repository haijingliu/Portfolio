                  <h3>Instruction Set for Strangers</h3>
                  <p1><p> As foreigners in the city of New York, 
                  we feel that New York (especially Time squire) is a place of business and sightseeing but never a home. 
                  We tried to invoke a contradictory feeling in Time Squire by introducing a private space where we would 
                  relax and take our mind off everything such as a bedroom to the heart of New York City.
                  As a result, we were using optical perspective of a bed frame to challenging visitors to make themselves at home in middle of Time Squire.

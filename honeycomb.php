                 <p1><p>“Staying in touch with current events at home, to your commute, to work or school.”</p>
                 <p>If news is tagged geographically, how can it be used to stay in touch with friends and family?</p> From the hyperlocal to national and global, how can people stay informed about the neighborhoods and cities they frequent? With a visualized mapping of this information around a user,
                 we want to create centrical experiences to better understand user-defined landscapes.</p>
                 How do users receive and share current events and updates already? What is missing or can be added? Where does a user see himself/herself in this experience?</p>
                 Show categorically ordered news ie. any news aggregator homepage like google news. While these types of aggregators provide an organized approach for searching for news, they lack a means of personally relating to these updates.</p>
                 With a visualized mapping of this information around a user, we want to create centrical experiences to better understand user-defined landscapes. News that is contextually aware, not only allows you to stay up to date with the information that matters to you,
                 but also curates a narrative of your environments.</p>

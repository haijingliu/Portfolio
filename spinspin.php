                  <h3>Social Intervention / human computer interface / metaphor</h3>
                  <p1><p>
Avidences have illustrated an invisible tendency of how virtual notions and objects fleetly corroding reality in massive towards the 21st century.</p> <p>Ironically, designers who initially created the artificial world were trying to use metaphors
from daily-life experience in order to provide more accessible ways, and to help to achieve a better hci experience.</p>
The other way round, cognitions and behaviors of users are affected by the frequency and familiarity of how they act in virtual as well as the emotions and comprehensions of how they express and recognize the world of virtual.</p>
Take a critically thinking approach, in case digital symbols, computer user interfaces were all appeared in reality could people recognize those metaphors behind? What is the real version of the userâ€™s virtual behavior in a physical context? 
How digital and physical making transitions to each other? <p>
So I took a little experiment of this classic icon, spinning ranibows of death, associating with Apple user interface that indicates human computer interactions of a machine waiting status.</p>
I simply create this a physical version of the interface with dc motor, take the interface to sites that "waiting" can be literally found in reality.
